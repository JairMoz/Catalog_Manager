This repository contains a practical solution for inventory data management using Python. The project focuses on automating the ingestion of external files and transforming raw data into manageable structures.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal was to efficiently process `CSV` inventory files, extracting specific information (such as product names) to generate quick reports and facilitate technical and administrative decision-making.

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Ingestion:** Effective use of the **Pandas** library to load and read data structures from flat files.
* **Data Transformation:** Converting `DataFrame` objects into native Python structures like `Lists` for seamless process integration.
* **Debugging & Problem Solving:** Resolved syntax and definition errors (e.g., `NameError`) and managed file pathing.
* **IT Automation:** Creating repeatable workflows for automated inventory analysis.

## 📂 Files Info:

* **`catalog_manager.ipynb`** — The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data loading logic and processing.
* **`inventory.csv`** — The source database containing the product listings.
